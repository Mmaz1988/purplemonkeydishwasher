======================

A public git version of my research projects, i.e. articles and all that. The
[publication list and
bibliographies](http://www.helsinki.fi/~tapirine/publications) are stored in
my university web site, along with pdf versions of the publications. The
versions on this git repository are authorâ€™s post-publication versions, unless
otherwise noted. They have been re-formatted for optimal *screen* reading,
which I currently believe is A5 (tablet) size, using hyperref package. Many
house styles conflict with this formatting, and therefore the papers from this
repo look very different from the originals.

The name of the repo refers to *broken telephone* / *indian whisper* gag in
Simpsons episode *PTA Disbands* (S6E21), which you should find very relevant to
my research.

The directory names follow the hierarchy of year-event-topic, where topic is
optional. The makefiles create the paper in format Pirinen-year-event..., this
is to identify that it is my author's post-publication draft version. The
makefiles should also try to reproduce the results in the paper, if possible.
This is what open science, the only proper form of science is about. For more
