Bibliographic references should use the author and year format \citep[section 12.3]{Mittelbach04}.  Bibliographic items in the References should contain full names, in the style of Computional Linguistics and CSLI Publications.  Style file \emph{cslipubs-natbib.bst} can be downloaded from CSLI Publications.

Examples should be in italics and numbered with Arabic numbers in parentheses, as illustrated in example (\ref{ex:bjoerka}).
Examples in languages other than English should contain glosses, preferably adhering to the Leipzig glossing rules when dealing with morphologically rich languages.

\begin{example} \label{ex:bjoerka}
\gll	Her går bjørk-a over 1200 meter, det er høyest i land-et.
	here goes birch-the over 1200 meters, that is highest in country-the
\glt	``Here birches grow over 1200 meters, that is the highest in the country."\glend
\end{example}

\noindent Figures should have a numbered caption below, while tables should have a numbered caption above.  Tables have thin borders on all sides and may have borders between cells as visually appropriate.
