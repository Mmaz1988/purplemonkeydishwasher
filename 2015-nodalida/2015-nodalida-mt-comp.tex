\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we report an experiment on rapid building of machine
  translation systems for three language pairs that are not of the same
  family. It is well known that rule-based machine translation is best
  suited to closely related languages and statistical machine translation
  also mainly works with reasonably closely related languages. In this
  paper we have selected three languages from different families none of
  which is English to show highlight how to build new language models atisticaland rule-based paradigms rapidly and how looking at not English data is
  interesting. We have selected for our use case Spanish from the
  indo-european family, Lithuanian from the Slavic family and Finnish from
  the Uralic family.
