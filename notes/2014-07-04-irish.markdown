# Irish-English RBMT

1. Converting current irish fst to new infras
    - apertium
    - giellatekno
    - maintainability
    - automatic testing
    - other tools
2. SMT vs. RBMT
    - both baselines must be built (e.g. to write an article)
    - hybrid systems
3. Abumatrany parts
    - Lexicon extension e.g. Mikel's eamt, hfst-guessers
    - Chunker (t1x) induction
    - lexical selection
    - other rules, reordering?
    - segmentation to morph. analysis -> morph smt
4. Apertium extensions (about the masters thesis)
    - collect an inventory of phrases and disjoints
    - e.g. transfer4
    - allow ? + * in t?x
    - dependencies
