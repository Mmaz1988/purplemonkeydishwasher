1. Compare segmentation algoritms both ways
    - Morfessor MAP, ML, baseline, fst-morphs, fst-words
    - 10 eval targets
    -> finalise the paper for mtm
    - verify unique sent pairs with paste | sort | uniq

Makefile has: morphs, words (from comps), bleu, ter, morfessor baseline
    needs oov

2. Scale morfessor training data 
    - size 25 %
     -> Makefile + split n 4

4. Scale TM training data size:
    - 12.5 % 25 % 50 %
    - plot segments advantage towards small data

3. Combining segmentations
    - intersections of segmentation points
    - n-best segmentations to lattice for decoding
    - tm training with n-best from 1.
    - weight setting: distribute evenly, find morfessors internals,
