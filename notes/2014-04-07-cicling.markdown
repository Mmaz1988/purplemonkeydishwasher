------------

Sentiment mining
================

* Data mining people always want to have mining attached
* Linguists have NEVER done anything with this, no exceptions
* it's a classification problem1
* blackouts yay
* considering sarcasm etc, is actually always hard

Readability
===========

* vocabulary (-word frequency probability)
* `<->` morphological complexity of Bangla? 
* Why is Bangla not suitable for classical features 

Posters
=======

* Compound Terms and their Multi-Word Variants
* Role of paraphrases in SMT
* Spelling Correction for Kazakh ( Aibek Makazhanov, Olzhas Makhambetov, Islam Sabyrgaliyev and Zhandos Yessenbayev.)


Unsupervised NLP
================

* learning morphology of lots of small classes with variations (I suppose
    you can cluster rare variations of stems and all)
* do we get anything from morph(eme) variation here?
* two-level rules are human readable
* why why why
* spending dozens of years to come up with unsupervised method is so much
  faster than just writing the rules in few months
* lot of sentences with the word x suddenly appear

bil extraction from comparable corpora
======================================

* combined similarity scoring over stuffs at 
    http://orchid.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~cju/code/iBiLexExtractor.tgz
* 10k WP docs w/ interlanguage links ?~100k noun bils

Nepal's languages encoding issues
=================================

* yeah it's a complex script
* Sikkim Herald

Some Challenges in lrls
=======================

* (poor countries like Finland will have a lot of underresourced languages)
* what with Piraha and recording cultural institutions (dan everett)
* loosing their language

Grammar checking
================
* it's non-word spelling if no context

Standardisation
================
* character-based smt for remind ape 
* twitterese !!
* yay for building lexicon

Unsupervised dependency parsing
===============================
* Burdened by linguistic rules!
* Can be tuned ==> must be tweaked with for ten years before they work
* dependency trees must be projective trees

Inferring paraphrases
=====================
* English has the snow words people just don't know / use them
* check if source

Bishnupriya Manipuri FST
=========================
* get it, compile it, spell-checkerise

* Sentiment lexicon generation, email for scriptsit

Commonsense knowledge
=====================
* lots of classical decision networks and logic

Argumentation analysis
======================
* bad service -> good grade in other services than this
